# gear_preadiction
Unsupervised gear prediction based on engine RPM and speed. Data curtesy of MyWheels.


In this project we create a model for unsupervised gear prediction in 82 different vehicles based on engine RPM and speed. 
This repository contains 
* a jupyter notebook with a description and discussion of the approach
* first_approach.py script which was used to generate graphs in the first approach as described in the jupyter notebook
* gear_predicion.py script for generating graphs and appended database with predictions following the second approach, as described in jupyter notebook
* 500 graphs produced by the second approach, each represetning a single trip of a given vehicle. These graphs were produced from data prior to interpolation (details in the notebook)

Please note that we were unable to upload the database used for the project for licensing reasons.
The author would like to thank MyWheels and Norbert Ryciak for access to the database and idea for the project.
